# BasicSATSolver

A basic Java SAT-Solver. Parses a String as a Boolean formula then computes all the interpretations to that formula.

The Boolean Formula can only consist of Conjunctions, Disjunctions and Negation. Each Boolean Variable can only be 1 Char long. The User Interface consist of the console. No GUI. The computed interpretations and the corresponding Formula Boolean Value are displayed in a table (or you can call it matrix I guess). Compile has to be in UTF-8 encoding.
